# madLibs
Description - This program enables users to create madLib activities by using regular expression patterns to identify nouns, adjectives, and verbs. If there is a match, users are asked to provide a new noun, adjective, or verb that will be inserted into the text. The program also uses python's open, write, and close functions in order to create text files that contain the new text.

Instructions - Users will need to download and import the re module.
